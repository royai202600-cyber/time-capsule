# Time Capsule / 時光膠囊 — concept pictures

Review concepts only. System vessels are **Corrupted Capsules / 破損膠囊**. A common Waypost is a quiet flat building; a Landmark Waypost is a larger flat navy building. The giant Corrupted Capsule appears inside the Landmark fight preview, not as its map marker.

## Roy to choose

- Ball: A smooth, B poured or C pressed wax.
- Gold treatment: solid brass-gold wax or branching brass-gold veins.
- Crack style: Corrupted A (large branching cracks) or Corrupted B (fine crackle).
- Common Waypost shape: small house, low wide hut or narrow kiosk.
- Common Waypost colour: flat brass or flat plum.
- Landmark Waypost shape: wide hall or two-storey building.
- Spinning object: pinwheel or four-envelope windmill.
- Portrait: bench or lamp.
- Scene: bench or lamp.

## Preserved art and file renames

Everything in `ball/` and `whoever/`, `screens/map-plain.png`, `screens/hit-dust.png`, and all common `waypost/simple-*` files from commit `8f6100e` stays byte-identical.

The four renamed capsule pictures are also byte-identical to their source blobs in that commit:
- `cracks/hourglass-corrupted-a.png`
- `cracks/hourglass-corrupted-b.png`
- `cracks/senado-corrupted-heavy.png`
- `screens/layers/capsule-corrupted.png`

They were renamed with `git mv`. The older Landmark screen is deleted.

## Independent app layers

Map, shadow, capsule, ball and dust remain separate. For catch/fight, the background is `screens/catch-background.png`; `screens/map-plain.png` is the live-map concept background.

Existing positioned 1024 × 1536 layers stay separate: `screens/layers/shadow.png`, `capsule-corrupted.png`, `capsule-mending.png`, `ball-a.png`, and `dust.png`. The fight adds independent `landmark-shadow.png` and `landmark-capsule.png` layers. No target, dial, ring or glow is drawn around a capsule. The app supplies the target and movement.

Both backgrounds are invented and show no real place, so the real-geography reference step does not apply. The catch background uses larger, calmer flat shapes than the live map.

## Script processing

Run from the repository root using Pillow in a temporary environment outside the repository:

```sh
/tmp/timecapsule-concept-venv/bin/python design/art/concepts/lost-and-found/make-review.py
```

The script writes only inside this concept folder. It does not re-save protected art or the renamed capsule pictures.

- The two new Landmark raw images are downscaled to 1024 without upscaling and padded to a white square if needed. White becomes transparent using darkness as alpha, normalised to navy ink density. Near-white noise is removed; RGB is constant navy #16263F.
- Common Waypost/spinner brass and plum masks remain unchanged. They were made from the existing raw shapes using the same darkness-to-alpha method.
- The Corrupted hourglass layer retains its exact 340 px width, y=260 position and artwork. Ball A remains the 180 px stand-in at its previous bottom-centre position.
- `screens/screen-throw.png` and `screen-hit.png` retain the exact positioned layers, sizes and order from `8f6100e`; only their background changes to the shared catch background.
- The mending layer is retained: full source pixels blended 60% toward the restored hourglass, then uniformly cropped/scaled like the Corrupted layer.
- `screens/screen-landmark-fight.png` composites catch background → enlarged existing soft shadow → the kept heavy Corrupted Senado capsule at 717 px wide, y=240 → the exact existing ball layer. The shadow's full alpha bounds preserve its soft edges. The separate fight capsule and shadow layers are exported.
- `screens/map-capsule-and-wayposts.png` keeps the previous live-map background, 200 px Corrupted hourglass and three 64 px brass Wayposts at their previous positions. It adds both navy Landmark buildings at 120 px wide on separate streets. No giant capsule is placed on this map.
- `checks/wayposts-64.png` preserves the common shape/colour comparison at 48 and 64 px and adds the two navy Landmark buildings at 64 and 96 px, all on map land #F3EFE6.
- `contact-sheet.png` is 2200 px wide, with sections Balls → Crack effect → Throw and hit → Common Wayposts → Landmark Waypost → To whoever passes by. It is the only image containing text.
- The kept crack overlays, Corrupted vessel effects, restored master, ball checks, portrait circles, scene fades and their checks retain the previously documented processing and pixels. Original crack effects reduce saturation by half, add cool mist, stretch the cracks to the vessel alpha bounding box and clip to the original alpha.

Visual review covers no writing/logos, no target artwork, the shared simple background, flat Landmark building silhouettes, independent layers and small-size readability. The two-storey raw source was regenerated once to remove unrequested windows. No app/browser/device integration is claimed.

## Exact final prompts for the three new pictures

Override for this image only: this is an empty full-bleed portrait phone-screen background, about 1024×1536, not an object on a transparent square. Ignore the style block's lines about ink line art, hatching, view, transparent background, centring, padding, square format and palette. Do not copy the objects or detail of the style sheet. Every pixel is filled using only: water #BCD3E6, land #F3EFE6, park #DCE6CF, sand #EFE3C6, building #E6E0D3, building top #EEE9DE, road #FFFFFF, road edge #D5DDE7, main road #F1E2BF, paper #F6F8FB.
A simple made-up backdrop built from large flat shapes: open pale land, one wide park shape, one curved road, a little water and only a few simple pale blocks near the edges. It is calmer and has bigger shapes than a street map, and is not a real place. The middle of the picture is open plain land. The top edge fades softly into paper #F6F8FB. Flat colour only, not painted. No outlines, labels, pins, trees, grass, cars, people, sky, clouds, phone frame, status bar, buttons, icons or circles.
