# 拾光 / Lost & Found — first concept review

Concepts for Roy's choice, generated with **gpt-image-2 through Codex's built-in image tool**. Not production assets. Only this concept folder is changed.

The maps are invented generic streets, not real geography. The real-geography reference step does not apply. Map colours were checked read-only against `mobile/src/features/journey/live/mapHtml.ts`.

## Roy to choose

- Ball: A smooth, B poured wax, or C pressed wax.
- Gold ball: solid brass-gold wax or red wax with bold branching gold veins.
- Crack style: A large branching cracks or B fine porcelain crackle.
- Waypost building: post hut, round kiosk, or wayside shelter.
- Spinner: pinwheel, cylindrical lantern, or letter rack.
- Portrait: bench or lamp.
- Scene: bench or lamp.

## Script-made files and review method

Run from the repository root, using a temporary Pillow environment outside the repository:

```sh
/tmp/timecapsule-concept-venv/bin/python design/art/concepts/lost-and-found/make-review.py
```

The script writes only under its own concept folder. No app, production art, manifests, migrations or settings are changed.

- Generated square pictures are downscaled to 1024 without upscaling. Native portrait screens are 1024 × 1536; wide scenes are 1536 × 1024.
- `cracks/crack-a-large.png` and `crack-b-fine.png`: grayscale darkness from the white raw image becomes alpha, faint paper noise is discarded, RGB is navy #16263F. An offset copy in glass blue #DCE8F2 adds a thin pale edge.
- `cracks/hourglass-lost-a.png` and `hourglass-lost-b.png`: approved master saturation reduced to 50%, cool glass-blue mist added, crack layer stretched to the master alpha bounding box then clipped to its alpha. Final alpha is reset to the original alpha, preserving the silhouette.
- `cracks/hourglass-restored.png`: byte-for-byte copy of `design/art/vessels/vessel-hourglass.png`.
- `cracks/proof-dome.png`, `proof-envelope.png`, `proof-maison.png`: the same crack A effect on the corresponding approved vessel masters. `other-vessels-proof.png` composes the three on paper.
- `cracks/senado-lost-heavy.png`: the same treatment on the Senado fountain master, using crack A plus a copy rotated 71 degrees.
- `whoever/portrait-a-bench.png` and `portrait-b-lamp.png`: downscaled then antialiased circular clipping at centre (505,526), radius 430 on a 1024 canvas. The global portrait script was not used.
- `whoever/scene-a-bench.png` and `scene-b-lamp.png`: existing alpha multiplied by a soft raised-cosine edge fade over 12% of the short edge. PNG metadata prevents repeated fades/crops.
- `checks/balls-64.png`: all five balls at a maximum visible dimension of 64 px, on map land and white road.
- `checks/hourglasses-120-64.png`: lost A, lost B and restored master at visible heights of 120 and 64 px.
- `checks/wayposts-64.png`: all three buildings and all three spinners at maximum visible dimension 64 px on map land.
- `checks/portraits-24-40.png`: both 1024 portrait canvases reduced to actual 24 and 40 px.
- `contact-sheet.png`: all generated pictures, final crack layers, lost/restored vessels, proof row, heavy landmark vessel and checks grouped 1–6. Width 2200 px. This is the only picture containing captions.

Visual review checked originality, no writing/logos, single brass rings, map rather than park backgrounds, ball silhouettes, matte treatment, portraits and scene subjects. Crack A is more legible at small size; crack B is intentionally subtle. Phone screens are concept illustrations, not pixel-exact compositions of vessel masters. No app/browser or physical-device integration is claimed.

## Exact final generation prompts

Every call begins with the unchanged section 2 style block. References are listed in the exact order supplied; the style sheet is first. Every generation passed on its first attempt; no rejected images are included.

Match the attached style sheet exactly.
Override for this image only: this is a full-bleed portrait phone screen, about 1024×1536, not one object on a transparent square. Ignore the style block's lines about transparent background, centring, padding and square format. Every pixel is filled. The map may also use these app map colours: water #BCD3E6, land #F3EFE6, park #DCE6CF, sand #EFE3C6, building #E6E0D3, building top #EEE9DE, road #FFFFFF, road edge #D5DDE7, main road #F1E2BF. The map has no ink outlines or hatching, so the hand-inked objects stand out. Inked objects still follow the style block.
The background is an invented street map seen from above at a gentle tilt, like a calm navigation map: flat pale land, a few white streets, one main road, low pale building blocks, one flat pale park shape and a little water. It is simple and quiet, with no labels, pins, trees, grass, cars, people, sky or clouds. The top edge fades softly into paper #F6F8FB. It is not a painted park or a separate scene, and not a camera view. Do not draw a phone frame, status bar, buttons, icons, counters or any other interface.
One hand-inked hourglass vessel matching reference 2 stands directly on the map in the upper middle, about one third of the screen wide, with a small soft shadow. Main action in middle. ONE thin hand-inked brass #C9A15A pen-line ring around it: slightly wobbly, unfilled, stroke ends overlap a little like a hand-drawn circle. Only one ring, no clock ticks, no second outline. No interface.
The ring is wide around the cracked hourglass. The plain red wax ball from reference 3 is rising from bottom centre, with two or three small hand-inked motion marks below it. No hand or character.
No text, letters, numbers, logos, writing-like marks, creatures, avatars, glossy 3D, floating item bubbles, gradient buttons, white or green rings. Ball has no seam, band, button, keyhole or emblem.

The ball has burst against the hourglass into a soft cloud of fine WAX-RED dust with a few brass specks; no ball remains. The ONE ring is tight around the vessel. Colour is coming back, only a few short faint cracks remain carrying a thin brass glint. Nothing goes inside anything.
No text, letters, numbers, logos, writing-like marks, creatures, avatars, glossy 3D, floating item bubbles, gradient buttons, white or green rings. Ball has no seam, band, button, keyhole or emblem.

- Clean ink line art with a slightly hand-drawn line, flat colour fills plus one soft shading tone, a little paper grain, light hatching only (it must still read at about 120 px). Lines in plum #6E2B3F or navy #16263F.
- Palette only: ink blue #2F5D8A, light blue #5A8FD0, glass blue #DCE8F2, plum #6E2B3F, brass #C9A15A, wax red #A3364F, navy #16263F, paper #F6F8FB, cream #F3E2BB. Warm brown wood is allowed for wooden objects.
- Front three-quarter view, soft top-left light. No text, letters, numbers, logos or real brands.
- Transparent background, object centred, generous padding (object fills about 70% of the canvas), square.
Match the attached style sheet exactly.
A small rotating brass stand holding a radial ring of cream sealed envelopes with plain wax-red seals, like an old postcard rack. Obvious central rotating axle, tactile finger-spinnable silhouette. Envelopes are blank.
One isolated concept object, simple enough to read at 64 px. No blue cube, tower, pylon, photo disc, text, letters, numbers, logos, writing-like marks, people, creatures or interface.

Override for this image only: this is a full-bleed portrait phone screen, about 1024×1536, not one object on a transparent square. Ignore the style block's lines about transparent background, centring, padding and square format. Every pixel is filled. The map may also use these app map colours: water #BCD3E6, land #F3EFE6, park #DCE6CF, sand #EFE3C6, building #E6E0D3, building top #EEE9DE, road #FFFFFF, road edge #D5DDE7, main road #F1E2BF. The map has no ink outlines or hatching, so the hand-inked objects stand out. Inked objects still follow the style block.
The background is an invented street map seen from above at a gentle tilt, like a calm navigation map: flat pale land, a few white streets, one main road, low pale building blocks, one flat pale park shape and a little water. It is simple and quiet, with no labels, pins, trees, grass, cars, people, sky or clouds. The top edge fades softly into paper #F6F8FB. It is not a painted park or a separate scene, and not a camera view. Do not draw a phone frame, status bar, buttons, icons, counters or any other interface.
ONE giant badly cracked Senado-fountain vessel from reference 2 stands directly on the map. Keep the exact low circular fountain-container design, wavy dark-and-cream side motif, circular water basin and central water spout from the reference. Towering over several low pale building blocks and clearly much larger than an ordinary map marker. Dulled colour, heavy navy cracks across it. No ring and no ball. No photo, real geography, text, letters, numbers, labels, writing-like marks, UI, creatures or characters.
